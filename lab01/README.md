# CS 262 - Lab01

This lab is based on [lab01](http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/262/kvlinden/01introduction/lab.html).

Answers to the lab questions:

- App.js: this is where you code your application using different resources and it shows everything that will be created and it will behave like native apps.

- package.json: this has certian dependencies and scripts for the application along with short cuts that can be used in the terminal when running your application.

- node_modules: this has all sorts of different modules or build tools that you can use in your application to give it functionality or styling and as a result create your whole application, and can be compared to libraries allowing us to add functionality to our application.

- .gitignore: .gitignore is a place where you can specify different keywords to let Git know which files that you don't want to use in other instances.
