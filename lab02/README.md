# CS 262 - Lab02

This lab is based on [lab02](http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/262/kvlinden/02management/lab.html).

Answers to the lab questions:

1. The name of the component in this application is App() where there are also subcomponents such as Veiw or Text or Button as well.

2. One prop is setName or possibly onChangeText as well and one state element is name in the code.

3. Curly braces {} are used to get the value of a state element or other element and use it however it is needed.

4. There is an anonymous function in the code in inputChange(); where it constantly is changing the text being displayed for the name.

5. No, this application when run on either Android or iOS, uses HTML and/or CSS but the react native framework does do something very similar.
